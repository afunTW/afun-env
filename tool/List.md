# Including
* [rsatool](https://github.com/ius/rsatool): rsatool calculates RSA (p, q, n, d, e) and RSA-CRT (dP, dQ, qInv) parameters given either two primes (p, q) or modulus and private exponent (n, d).
* [pkcrack](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~conrad/krypto/pkcrack.html): The attack is a known plaintext attack, which means you have to know part of the encrypted data in order to break the cipher.
